# Claude Code Instructions

This project uses [FADE](https://github.com/themitchelli/fade) (Framework for Agentic Development and Engineering).

## Quick Start

1. Read `./FADE.md` for project context, coding standards, and boundaries
2. Read `./fade/prompt.md` for your execution instructions
3. The prompt.md file will guide you to other FADE files

## File Locations

```
./FADE.md           # Project context (read this first)
./fade/
  ├── prompt.md     # Your execution instructions
  ├── progress.md   # Session history
  ├── learned.md    # Cumulative discoveries
  ├── prds/         # PRD queue
  ├── prd.json      # Priority PRD (optional)
  └── prd-archive/  # Completed PRDs
```
